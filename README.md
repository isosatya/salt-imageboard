## Imageboard project part of SPICED coding bootcamp (2019)

This project was purely done with Vue.js framework.
The same is simply about an imageboard where user can upload their pictures, along with some basic information. Other users can then make comments on each of these picture, without the need to login. These picture can then include different tags, through which all the images with the same tag are displayed by clicking on one of these tags.
